# SysinternalsSuite-Updater
A script to automatically update SysInternals

To use the Script you will only need to change the path in the Script section.

The Script will automatically create a Folder under the Path to Downlad all Sysinternal Tools.
As well as a Folder for the Log Files.

When the Script starts it will compair the currently downloaded versions with the versions at https://live.sysinternals.com
and download new ones as well as new versions.
